long_description: "The Univie Standardizer is a KNIME node designed to standardize molecular structures in a dataset. It leverages the molvs Python package along with custom code developed by the Pharmacoinformatics Research Group at the University of Vienna. This node offers a wide range of options to process, sanitize, and standardize molecules to facilitate further analysis and modeling tasks. Key features include:
    * Sanitization of molecules using RDKit
    * Handling of stereochemistry (keep, remove, or clean)
    * Removal of fragments and uncharging molecules
    * Disconnecting metal atoms
    * Normalization and reionization of molecules
    * Keeping only the largest fragment of a molecule
    * Canonicalization of tautomers
    This node takes an input table containing molecular structures and outputs a table with standardized molecules, along with additional columns containing information on inorganic content if required. By providing a comprehensive set of options for molecular standardization, the Univie Standardizer node is a valuable tool for researchers working with molecular datasets in KNIME."
